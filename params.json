I would not change anything in Arch Linux because I believe it's perfect. So, I just added a curses-based installer to make initial setup easier.\r\n\r\nRight now it's a bit incomplete and a bit outdated, so use it at your own risk, but still nice and usable. And PRs are always welcome!\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding an ISO\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n#### Requirements\r\n\r\n* Arch Linux running on x86_64;\r\n* archiso package.\r\n\r\nGot no Arch and you don't know how to install it? Try building Energy in a Docker container.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Instructions\r\n\r\n1. Run `make`.\r\n2. Done. You will get a dual-architecture ISO in the `out/` folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstalling\r\n----------\r\n\r\n1. Write this ISO to a CD or USB stick.\r\n2. Boot it up.\r\n3. Run `./install.sh` and follow the instructions.\r\n4. Something seems to be wrong?
